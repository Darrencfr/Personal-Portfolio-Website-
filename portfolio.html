                <br><p>"4=10" is a simple yet challenging math-based puzzle game that tests your arithmetic skills, logical reasoning, and creativity. The objective of the game is to use exactly four numbers (typically provided at random) and any combination of basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses, etc.) to create an equation that equals 10. The challenge lies in figuring out the correct sequence of operations and numbers to reach the target result.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>1.Dynamic Number Generation</strong></p>  
                <li>The game generates random sets of four numbers for each puzzle, ensuring a unique challenge every time.</li><br>
                <p><strong>2.Mathematical Operations</strong></p>
                <li>Players can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to manipulate the numbers into forming an equation that equals 10.</li>
                <li>The order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) is enforced to ensure accurate solutions.</li><br>
                <p><strong>3.Difficulty Levels</strong></p>
                <li>Level progression from easy to hard</li><br>
